		<h1>Hayden's GitHub Pages Site</h1>
		
		<p>Hello! If you're reading this, you're probably looking for my personal website. As of 3 April 2020, my personal page is now located at <a href="https://www.haywalk.ca">www.haywalk.ca</a>.</p>
		
		<p>Since this is a GitHub pages site, it's possible you were looking for my GitHub profile, which you can find <a href="https://github.com/haywalk">here</a>.</p>
		
		<p>On my new site, you can find a <a href="https://www.haywalk.ca/misc/museum.php">museum of my old Web pages</a>!</p>
		
		<h2>Why the move?</h2>
		
		<p>My new site is hosted on my own server, which gives me more control over it, as well as access to tools like PHP.</p>
		
		<h2>Why is this page still here?</h2>
		
		<p>Posterity. I have told people about, and sent e-mails linking to, this site. By keeping this page here, anyone looking for me will be able to find me.</p>
		
		<p>I've considered using this page for project updates, but it's easier to use <a href="https://www.haywalk.ca/blog">my blog</a> for that. My blog is run by <a href="https://github.com/haywalk/simpleblogscript">a script that I wrote</a>, and you can use it, too!</p>
