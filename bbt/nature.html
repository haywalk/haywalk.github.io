			Our increased reliance on digital technology has torn us from nature, and is beginning to take a toll on our mental and physical health. Learning to regulate one's
			screentime can lead to an increase in happiness and fulfillment, and better health. In BBT, we did a 'nature walk' exercise, and I observed my classmates seeming more
			talkative and relaxed, and paying more attention to their environments.<br><br>
			
			"Nature defecit disorder" is a term coined by a (since forgotten by me) individual, that is meant to illustrate our deprivation of time outdoors, and I believe that,
			as a social issue, it is very much real. The complications are very visibly in our teens and young adults, and even children: Poorer eyesight; increased disability; higher
			rated of ADHD and other autism-spectrum disorders, among other things. The cause is simple: Individuals are facing increased exposure to technology at increasingly young ages,
			building dependencies and facing the scientifically-proven consequences, like addiction, as well as the above-mentioned.<br><br>
			
			Finding a balance between overuse and non-use is crucial; overuse can be deadly, but non-use is simply impractical. The balance lies in moderation: Limiting screen time
			while still usin technology as the tool that it was meant to be. Personally, I've tried and continue to try to limit my screen time, despite usually failing at doing so.
			However, I do reserve that my technology use is almost entirely educational, and I don't spend very much time "passively" using social media, etc. Nonetheless, a balance is needed,
			and I must find one.
