			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hello. This is my first post to the blog portion of the site. Still
			working out some bugs, but I'm satisfied with how my site is comin along so far.
			Expect frequent design changes, with the odd blog post. Might start posting to YouTube once in
			a while. I'll probably mainly post thrift and yardslae finds here, as I enjoy browsing at
			flea markets and pawn stores. Easter was yesterday, so all the stores were closed for Good Friday,
			Easter and Easter Monday (An exclusively Canadian and British Holiday), but Saturday all the stores
			were open so I went hunting. I went to Value Village and the alvation army, and I found a Walkman!
			I've been looking for one for a while because I took apart my other cassette player for trransistors.
			Payed $6.00 for the walkman, and it worked perfect. Even came with batteries!
