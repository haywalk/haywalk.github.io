			This is a project I came up with after watching youtube videos on 8-Bit Computer Clock Logic,
			Synthesizers and homemade AM Radio Transmitters. I plan on using 3 555 timers and an AM radio
			crystal to build a working miniature Sputnik. It will use 3 555 ICs. The first will pulse on
			and off at regular intervals and the curremt will be sent to the next two, which are connected
			to create a Stepped-Tone Generator, known commonly as an Atari Punk Console, that will generate
			square waves to be sent through the AM Crystal and picked up by an AM radio. Shouldn't be too hard,
			and I'll put the plans on the <A HREF="downloads.html">Downloads</A> page when they're done.
