		<b>Trying the Windows Linux Subsystem</b><br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put my Windows drive back in and ran a factory reset; wanted to try some of the features
		that were introduced since I switched to Linux. WLS is a really cool idea, and I'd like to find a cool way to use it.
		Also, I've been using the light theme (didn't exist before I left) which looks great. Plus, when I did the reset, I turned
		off most of Microsoft's botnet, so things are pretty good. Planning on staying with Linux, though, as programming is hard
		with Windows (UNIX beats all in terms of programming).
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do, however, want to be able to jump into Windows faster in case I need to, and I'd also like
		to lighten up my Linux distro. So I intend on doing the following:
		<ul>
			<li>I got a Raspberry Pi, so I'm going to make a server to keep photos/docs/etc., to free up space;</li>
			<li>I'm going to create a Linux partition on the same HDD as Windows; and,</li>
			<li>I plan on switching to a lighter distro; likely Debian.</li>
		</ul>

		<b>Cool Calculators</b><br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days ago (on the 16th) I finally caved and purchased a TI-83 Plus graphing calculator,
		which was on clearance at my local suprmarket for a price as close to fair as a Texas Instruments product can be sold for.
		Recently, my interest in calculators has grown, and I have something of a collection now. I'll put up apage
		dedicated to my programs for the calculator  <a href="ti83.html">here</a>, in case I make anything interesting. So far, I've done
		a quadratic solver, as well as FizzBuzz (which was harder than expected, as models below the TI-84 series lack a remainder function).
		Cheers!
