			Microsoft Sway is a REVOLUTIONARY platform for expressing yourself and conveying ideas. It's like PowerPoint, but more in-style: Microsoft realized that "ease-of-use"
			and "practicality" are things of the past, and designed their new presentation platform with the future in mind. Remember the old slide-projector layout of PowerPoint?
			OH RIGHT! Millenials don't know what a slide projector is! So obviously, instead of basing Sway on a concrete physical object, Miscrosoft chose to make it completely abstract,
			just like the poetry that their customers listen to at coffee shops instead of working.<br><br>
			The question remains: How might one *use* Sway? The answer is: One doesn't. Microsoft realized that they have more artistic talent than the average consumer, and thus removed
			all customization properties, so one only needs to insert a few lines of "emphasised" or "accented" (archaically "boldened" and "italicised," respectively) text and the
			odd Bing image to create the perfect cookie-cutter presentation that is sure to impress our reptillian corporate overlords. THANKS, SWAY!
