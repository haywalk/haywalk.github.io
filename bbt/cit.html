			Theoretically, the digital citizenship unit is the most important unit to cover in BBT. Why? Because the Internet is everywhere; we all use it,
			and thus we should know how to use it properly. I do reserve, however, that the (provincially-proscribed) structure of the unit was ineffective
			in serving this purpose, however that is no fault of the teacher. Some units of note include:
			<ul>
				<li>Unit 1: Digital Security
					<ul>
						<li>On a platform where it's very simple to hand over all your personal information and destroy your computer in the process, learning the
						ins-and-outs of digital security is a must.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Unit 3: Digital Rights and Responsibilities
					<ul>
						<li>When you've got the world on your screen, it's important to know how to behave in a way that accomodates others.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Unit 4: Digital Etiquette
					<ul>
						<li>When behind a screen, it can feel like the people you're talking to aren't people at all; that's why it's necessary to learn proper etiquette.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Unit 5: Digital Wellness
					<ul>
						<li>Now that everyone is thoroughly addicted to digital technology, it's crucial to maintain physical and mental health.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Unit 8: Digital Law
					<ul>
						<li>Why not pirate that season of your favourite show, while working on a reference-less research paper? Because it's illegal. This unit
						talks about the law and teaches what can and can't be done on the WWW.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
