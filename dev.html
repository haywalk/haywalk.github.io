					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lately, I've been working on sharpening my HTML/CSS skills so that in the future, I can make Web sites for a fee.
					Here is a portfolio of some of my work:<br><br>
					
					<img id="img" src="https://i.imgur.com/AAGsqey.jpg" style="margin-left: 25;" name="slideshow"><br>
					<button type="button" onClick="changeImage(-1)" style="margin-left: 25;">Previous</button>
					<button type="button" onClick="changeImage(1)" style="">Next</button>
					
					<div class="devdesc">
						<ul style="width: 300; float: right; margin-top: -325; margin-right: 25;">
							
							<li>The first image is of the new version of the Indie Link Room, still a WIP.</li>
							<li>The next image is of a portfolio site I made for a friend who does graphic design. It is not currently On-Line.</li>
							<li>The third image is of the third version of this site. The current site is V4.</li>
							<li>The fourth image is of this site's version two homepage. Not overly pretty, but quite practical.</li>
							<li>The fifth image is of version one of this site. Groovy, eh?</li>
							<li>The last picture is of the V2 site decorated for Christmas 2017.</li>
						</ul>
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbspI learned HTML from a school course my that friend sent me, and I'll put it on the 
						<A HREF="downloads.html">Downloads</a> page. I don't know who wrote it, but it's for educational
						purposes so it's probably alright to give out. I learned CSS from <A HREF="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3schools</A>.
