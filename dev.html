				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lately, I've been working on sharpening my HTML/CSS skills so that in the future, I can make Web sites for a fee.
				This site is not one of my better sites, but it gets the job done very well. Here is a portfolio of some of my work:

			<div class="devex">
				<ul>
					<li>The first image is of the third version of this site. The current site is V2. I reverted to this one because I liked the vibe more.</li>
					<li>The next image is of the new version of the Indie Link Room, still a WIP.
					<li>The third image is of version one ov this site. Groovy, eh?</li>
					<li>The fourth image is of a portfolio site I made for a friend who does graphic design. It is not currently On-Line.</li>
					<li>The fifth image is of this site's homepage. Not overly pretty, but quite practical.</li>
					<li>The last picture is of this site decorated for Christmas 2017.</li>

				I learned HTML from a school course my that friend sent me, and I'll put it on the 
				<A HREF="downloads.html">Downloads</a> page. I don't know who wrote it, but it's for educational
				purposes so it's probably alright to give out. I learned CSS from <A HREF="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3schools</A>.
