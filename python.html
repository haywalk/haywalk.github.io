		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This summer I've been spending a lot of time with Python,
		and am becoming quite confident with the language. This page will serve as a sort
		of portfolio, with the source code available <a href="https://github.com/haywalk/Portfolio">here</a>.

		<!--GAME OF LIFE-->
		22 August 2019<br>
		<span style="font-weight: bold">Conway's Game of Life</span><br>
		<img src = "photos/lifegame.png" style = "float: right; border-left: 2px solid white;">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is my take on John Horton Conway's "Game of Life," a
		cellular automaton that simulates life. It took me about two hours, and I was extremely
		satisfied when I got it working. The rules are as follows:
		<ul>
			<li>If a living cell has under two neighbours, it dies of underpopulation;</li>
			<li>If a living cell has over three neighbours, it dies of crowding;</li>
			<li>If a living cell has two or three neighbours, it lives into the next cycle (1 second)</li>
			<li>If a dead cell has three living neighbours, it becomes living.</li>
		</ul>

		<!--AQUARIUM-->
		19-21 August 2019<br>
		<span style="font-weight: bold">Aquarium</span><br>
		<img src="photos/aquarium.png" style = "float: right; border-left: 2px solid white;">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A simple aquarium made with PyGame and the random library. When run, a window will
		appear, and a random number of fish, each with a random breed, start point, and speed,
		will appear. If a fish hits the edge of the screen, it will turn around; furthermore,
		each game cycle (50 milliseconds) each fish has a 1% chance of changing direction on
		its own. Aquarium noises play in the background. I feel like this program was my first
		really meaningful use of object-oriented programming, as the fish spawning would have been
		very difficult without simply creating instances of a class.
