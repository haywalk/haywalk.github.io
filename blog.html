		<b>Cool Calculators</b><br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days ago (on the 16th) I finally caved and purchased a TI-83 Plus graphing calculator,
		which was on clearance at my local suprmarket for a price as close to fair as a Texas Instruments product can be sold for.
		Recently, my interest in calculators has grown, and I have something of a collection now. I'll put up apage
		dedicated to my programs for the calculator  <a href="ti83.html">here</a>, in case I make anything interesting. So far, I've done
		a quadratic solver, as well as FizzBuzz (which was harder than expected, as models below the TI-84 series lack a remainder function).
		Cheers!
