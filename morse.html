			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I don't even really know how this happened. I was sorting through boxes of random junk, trying
			to make room for, well... more junk, when I came across a chart of the International Morse Code Alphabet. Seeing this made
			me want to learn the code, so I took to the internet. I found a program that takes Morse Codde from your mouse and decrypts
			it into letters of the Latin Alphabet. I was sort of bored of using my mouse, and wanted a real key. Then, lo and behold, I
			spot an old Lenovo USB mouse on top of the drawer next to my desk. Combined with a block of wood, some screws, a bracket from
			an old cassette player, a skewer and a Quarter Dollar, it became a functional (for my program, anyway) Morse Code straight key.
			<BR><BR>
			It was quite simple, really.<BR><BR>
			
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, naturally, I ripped apart the mouse and harvested its insides. Without context, that sounds
			mildly psychopathic.<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I used the gaps in the mouse's circuit board to secure it to the block of wood. I also added an extra
			screw near the front of the block to use for cable management.<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, I attached the L-shaped bracket I found in an audio tape recorder.
			This will hold the actual lever that will press down on the left button of the circuit board.<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, I hot-glued the skewer into the corner of said bracket, then cut the skewer to an appropriate
			length and hot-glued on a Quarter to use as a handle. From there I simply added a little more glue near the base of the skewer so
			that it could better reach the contact on the PCB.
