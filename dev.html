			Right now I've been working on sharpening my HTML/CSS skills, and someday I might design
			webpages for a small cost or maybe free as a hobby, but I want to get better at it first.
			This website isn't my prettiest, but it's my only one that's currently online and the only one 
			that I've written so far using a combination of HTML and CSS. Here are some photos of other
			sites I've built but havent launched:

			The original Planet Haywalk Site. It has some '90s-esque charm, but I think the current site
			is more functional, and definately easier on the eyes. (Space-Jam Background :3)

			A site I built for my friend who does Graphic Designs. At the time I couldn't figure out how
			to get it online, so he went with a template site instead. It' very simple, and with my new
			CSS knowledge I could have done a far better job, but it looks clean and I like it.

			I learned HTML from a school course my that friend sent me, and I'll put it on the 
			<A HREF="downloads.html">Downloads</a> page. I don't know who wrote it, but it's for educational
			purposes so it's probably alright to give out. I learned CSS from <A HREF="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3schools</A>.
