			My biggest takeaway from this course has been our culture's astounding feat of simultaneously using technology to a point of danger, allthewhile still not
			gaining from it. One would imagine that if all the country's youth were glued to computers, we'd have landed on Mars by now. Instead, however, we have gotten
			nowhere near there; instead, our youth have grown unhealthy both mentally and physically, and it seems as if curiosity into how computers function no longer
			exists. 30 years ago if people had this technology, they'd have been dissecting it and learning its ins-and-outs, but that simply doesn't happen anymore. Instead,
			we passively enjoy digital technology without caring how it works. I think that the most important unit was the nature unit, as it gave a lot of perspective to
			our reliance on these systems.
