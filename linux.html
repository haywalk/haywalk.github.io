19 Feb/19<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So on Sunday (it is now Tuesday), I decided I'd finally try my hand at Linux. Having been 
		a life-long user of Windows, I decided to go with Linux Mint, as the desktop environment seemed to be the most familiar.
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that evening, I dug a 500GB HDD out of a scorched E-Machine in the basement, hooked it up in my prized Optiplex, and
		booted linux mint from my car-shaped flash drive that I've accordingly dubbed the "Linux Mint Mobile" (Picture below).
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My ultimate plan is to hook up both HDDs, and dual-boot between Windows 10 and Linux Mint. My
		goal is to use Windows as a main OS for work, games, entertainment, and social media, while dedicating Mint to development and
		experimentation. I feel better doing that stuff in Mint because it's free and if I fry it I can simply reinstall it :-P<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've also been playing around with the Git shell, and that will be how I push this page to Github. :-)<br><br>
